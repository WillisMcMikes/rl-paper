Codes for RL thesis

The codes in this repositry were used in my introductory reinforcement learning paper for the UCT honours reading module on the topic. Included are codes for a DQN and DDPG lunar lander agent, as well as DQN and IQL for SlimeVolleyGym.

## DQN and DDPG

These are the codes that were used for example implementations of single-agent RL, using the LunarLander environment. The codes are strong adaptations of Phil Tabor's codes from his YouTube tutorial series.

## DQN and IQL

These are codes that were used to train the slime agent in [SlimeVolleyGym](https://github.com/hardmaru/slimevolleygym). Huge credit to Claude Formanek for his assistance here.
